<p>The aim of this questionnaire is to get acquainted with your typical personality. For this reason, we would like you to choose your most common reaction to different situations from the multiple choice options. Below are some examples of the type of question asked (please note that these are only examples, not valid questions).</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>I am very thorough when tidying up my things and everything must be exactly in the right place</p>
	<ul>
		<li>a-true</li>
		<li>b-intermediate</li>
		<li>c-false, I am quite happy if most things are pretty much in order</li>
	</ul>

	<p>When I am bothered by a person's behavior</p>
	<ul>
		<li>a-I am straightforward</li>
		<li>b-Intermediate</li>
		<li>c-I am more diplomatic</li>
	</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>When choosing your answer please remember the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Preferably select the first or third option for most questions, choosing the one that <em>best suits</em> your personality, although you may not always react the same way. Only choose the second option when it is absolutely impossible to choose either of the other two.</li>
	<li><em>Do not overthink your answers</em>. Generally, the first thing that comes to mind is the answer that best describes your typical behavior.</li>
	<li>Answer <em>all</em> the questions. If any of the situations described is not common to you, simply consider how you would react in such a circumstance.</li>
	<li>Remember that <em>there is no right or wrong answer</em>. This questionnaire is about your usual behavior and all answers are valid and valuable.</li>
	<li>Also remember that your answers cannot be better or worse. <em>You will not be displaying a negative or a positive image</em>, since the questionnaire only distinguishes individual differences, e.g. when we find someone else's behavior upsetting, it might be better to be "blunt and direct" or maybe more "diplomatic". Both choices have their positive side.</li>
</ul>

<p>When answering a question, do not think of how you would like it to be or what would be the right thing to do, but <em>how you actually are</em>. For example, do not dwell on whether you think it is better to "tidy up very thoroughly" or whether you should just "tidy up most things". Simply answer what you usually do without analyzing what the question is getting at or what it is trying to find out about you. The questionnaire has been designed to detect combinations of answers that seek to display a positive image. Be spontaneous when answering the questions: your honesty will greatly be appreciated.</p>
